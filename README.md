# README by Alexander Diaz

## Introduction
This is my first Web project in RVCC using GitHub. I also want to say hello to Professor Caruso, and thanks to him and all the other web developers (potentially including myself).

## Description
This project is not only a good demonstration for my own skills with the Internet, but also a golden opportunity to express myself.
### Contents
While most of the content is included in *index.html*, there is also other content listed in major parts of these files, especially the CSS file. As a result, we will review *index.html*, *style.css*, and **then** the other files.
