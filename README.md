# *README* by Alexander Diaz

## Introduction
This is my first Web project in RVCC using GitHub. I also want to say hello to Professor Caruso, and thanks to him and all the other web developers (potentially including myself). It introduces myself.

## Description
This project is not only a good demonstration for my own skills with the Internet, but also a golden opportunity to express myself. .
### Contents
While most of the content is included in *index.html*, there is also other content listed in major parts of these files, especially the CSS file. As a result, we will review *index.html*, *style.css*, and **then** the other files.
**Header:** The header describes the document (says that it is part of Web development), and connects to the major sections of the page. While I think that the colors don't necessarily line up, it still looks okay overall to me.
**Bio:** This is the part that describes the basics on who I am.
