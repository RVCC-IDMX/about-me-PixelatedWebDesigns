# *README* by Alexander Diaz

## Introduction
This is my first Web project in RVCC using GitHub. I also want to say hello to Professor Caruso, and thanks to him and all the other web developers (potentially including myself).

## Description
This project is not only a good demonstration for my own skills with the Internet, but also a golden opportunity to express myself. I am using this project to display my knowledge of web design, personal interests, and educate myself (and hopefully someday others as well).

### Contents
While most of the content is included in *index.html*, there is also other content listed in major parts of these files, especially the CSS file. As a result, we will review *index.html*, *style.css*, and **then** the other files.

**Header:** The header describes the document (says that it is part of Web development), and connects to the major sections of the page. While I think that the colors don't necessarily line up, it still looks okay overall to me.

**Bio:** This is the part that describes the basics on who I am. While it is not as big as I want it to be, I think that it teaches a lot about myself. I am glad to be in this class, and I am eager to present this project.

**Blog:** This section describes things about Web design, and has fun facts about myself as well.

**Additional content**: I also embedded the information, particularly pictures. The pictures show things that I like, which kind of go along with the hobbies. The video wasn't as filling as I wanted it to be, but I think it still looks pretty good.

## How I Rate It
To be honest, I would give this project a(n) 8 out of 10. I could have put more work into it before the last day, but I have put in a lot of work now.
