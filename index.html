            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Pixel art: Pixel art is possibly my favorite computer hobby. Pixel art is basically the art of packing designs as tightly as possible by drawing them at the individual pixel level while still looking neat.</li>
                <li>Music: I have been interested in music for a while. I am in a theater club where I perform.</li>
                <li>Work out: even though I do not work out very much, I still try my best to get out and do it.</li>
