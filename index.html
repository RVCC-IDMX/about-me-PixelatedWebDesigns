                    <li>I am looking forward to learning more.</li>
                    <li>I have seen new tags that I've never worked with, starting with section and header.</li>
                    <li>I have been known to be good at computer stuff.</li>

                <li>Pixel art: Pixel art is possibly my favorite computer hobby. Pixel art is basically the art of packing designs as tightly as possible by drawing them at the individual pixel level while still looking neat.</li>
                <li>Music: I have been interested in music for a while. I am in a theater club where I perform. We do songs, and sometimes also do presentations with music.</li>
                <li>Work out: even though I do not work out very much, I still try my best to get out and do it.</li>
                <li>Political Analysis: I try to predict elections, months and sometimes years in advance. Though I am a left-wing person, I try to leave that out of when I make my predictions and look at the data like with other things I do.</li>

		  <ul>
			   <li><b>Asynchronous</b> I don't have to come in. Unlike many other classes, I feel that is a good thing because it allows me to work on things at my own pace more, and carve out time to work on it more fully.</li>
			   <li><b>HTML-based</b> Even though HTML is often seen as a simplistic language, it has far-reaching applications, mostly as supporting the backbone of web design. HTML is a good start for many to learn programming in general.</li>
			   <li><b>Practical ideas</b> In the past, I have worked on similar projects, including for a web class in high school that covered some of the topics we are talking about right now.</li>

				This blog section will discuss the use and applications of image hovering in HTML and CSS. Here is an example of an image with CSS and HTML allowing the image to transition out into "dummy" text (embedded in an <i>iframe</i>): <br>
		  		<iframe src="./iframe-image.html" width="17.5%" height="125%"></iframe>
		  		Now, I will explain some of the basics on how to integrate HTML, CSS, and image hovering together.
		  		<h2>HTML</h2>
				<h3>Part 1: <i>img</i> tag</h3>
				Like all images in HTML, we need to use the "img" tag to tell the browser that this is an image to be shown on the page, and not another type of data. An example is <i>">&lt;img src="my-image.jpg" class="image-hov"&gt;</i></span>
				<h3><i>Part 2:</i> CSS inclusion (<i>class</i> or <i>id</i>)</h3>
				Generally speaking, in order to incorporate code into CSS, we need to set a property to link it to CSS, namely <i>class</i> or <i>id</i>. These elements tell CSS which parts of the HTML to interact with.
				<h3>Connecting the CSS file with <i>link</i></h3>
				While it is possible to create a CSS <i>within</i> a page by using a <i>style</i> tag, most web developers generally recommend using a separate file, as we do on this particular mini-site. Once you have configured the HTML and CSS files, these are the steps that you should do to get this working.
		  		<h2>CSS</h2>
		  		<h3><i>transition</i></h3>
		  		This part of the code is supposed to allow to specify the manner in which transition the picture from one color (or image) to the other. This is done by slowly (or quickly) fading the picture into a certain picture. This is an example <i>transition</i> line: <i></i>
